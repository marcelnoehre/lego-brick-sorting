# Lego Brick Sorting

## Installing Dependencies on Raspberry Pi
This guide outlines how to set up a Python environment and install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file.

### 1) Update System and Install Dependencies
First, update your system to ensure everything is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Next, install Python, pip, and required build tools:

```bash
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev build-essential
```

### 2) Check Python and Pip Versions
Verify that Python and pip are installed:

```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
```

### 3) Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment for your project to avoid conflicts with system-wide packages.

Create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your prompt should change to indicate that you are now working inside the virtual environment.

### 4) Install Dependencies from requirements.txt
With the virtual environment active, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5) Verify the Installation
To confirm that the dependencies are installed, you can check the installed packages:

```bash
pip3 list
```

### 6) Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When youâ€™re done, deactivate the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Hardware Requirements
Before running the project, ensure the following hardware components are properly connected to the Raspberry Pi:

- **Raspberry Pi Camera**: Ensure the camera is connected and enabled.
- **Relay (16 Channels)**: Connect the relay board to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins for valve control. Make sure to connect the 5V and GND pins as well.
- **Motor Driver (optional)**: If you're using a motor driver for vibratory plate control, connect it to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. Make sure to connect the GND pins as well.
- **Optocoupler (optional)**: If you're using an optocoupler for handling light barrier events, connect it to Raspberry Pi's GPIO pin. Make sure to connect the 5V and GND as well.  

### Configuration
The GPIO pin IDs for the above components can be configured in the file:

- **`config/hardware_config.py`**

In this file, you can set the specific GPIO pin IDs used for the **Raspberry Pi Camera**, **Relay**, and **Vibration Plate with Light Barrier**. You can also adjust additional settings for the camera, light barrier, and valves within this file.

If a **vibration plate** is available, you can enable it by adjusting the flag in:

- **`config/flags.py`**

### Example Configuration
Here is an example of how the configuration could look:

Example: ```hardware_config.py```

```python
